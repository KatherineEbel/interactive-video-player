Now that we've looked at the architecture
of the internet, let's see how you might &nbsp;

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.535
connect your personal devices to
the internet inside your house.<br>

3
00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:11.270
Well there are many ways to
connect to the internet, and &nbsp;

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.960
most often people connect wirelessly. &nbsp;

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.940
Let's look at an example of how
you can connect to the internet.<br>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.370
If you live in a city or a town,
you probably have a coaxial cable for &nbsp;

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.880
cable Internet, or a phone line if you

If you live far out in the country,
you'll more likely have&nbsp;

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.430
a dish outside your house, connecting
you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or &nbsp;

11
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.190
you might also use the telephone system.<br>

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.300
Whether a wire comes straight from
the ISP hookup outside your house, or &nbsp;

13
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.270
it travels over radio
waves from your roof, &nbsp;

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.760
the first stop a wire will make once
inside your house, is at your modem.<br>

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
A modem is what connects the internet
to your network at home. &nbsp;
